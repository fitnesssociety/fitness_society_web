 <h1>fitnesSociety Fitness Coach Booking Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: May 1, 2023</p>
  <br/>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to fitnesSociety, where we provide a convenient and easy-to-use online platform for users to book fitness coaches. By using our app and booking a fitness coach through our platform, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this booking policy. Please read this policy carefully before booking a coach through our app.</p>
  <br/>
    <h2>2. Booking Process</h2>
      <p>To book a fitness coach through our platform, you must first create an account with us by providing your name, email address, and other required information. Once you have created an account, you can browse through our list of available coaches and select the one that best suits your needs. Each coach may require different information from you, so please be sure to review their booking requirements carefully before booking a session with them.</p>

    <p>After selecting a coach, you will need to provide the coach with any additional information they require for the session. This may include your age, weight, or other personal information that the coach needs to provide you with a safe and effective workout.</p>

    <p>Once the coach has received your booking request and all necessary information, they will confirm your session and provide you with further instructions. Please note that payment for the session will be settled offline between you and the coach, as our platform does not accept payments.</p>

  <br/>
    <h2>3. Coach Availability</h2>
    <p>The availability of coaches on our platform depends on their discretion. Each coach has the ability to set their availability status and schedule through our platform. We make every effort to ensure that the coaches listed on our website are available for the dates and times that you have requested, based on the information provided by the coach. However, we cannot guarantee that the coach you select will be available at the exact time and date you have requested. </p>
 <br/>
 <h2>4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Cancellation and rescheduling policies are determined by the fitness coach and are not the responsibility of fitnesSociety. If you need to cancel or reschedule your session, please contact your coach directly to work out the details.</p>
 <br/>
    <h2>5. Feedback and Review Policy</h2>
    <p>If you are not satisfied with your coaching session or have any feedback, you can provide a review of your coach on our platform. This feedback is important to help us improve our platform and the quality of our coaches. Please keep in mind that reviews must be respectful and appropriate, and must not contain any offensive language or personal attacks.</p>
 <br/>
<br/>
    <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Refund policies are determined by the fitness coach and are not the responsibility of fitnesSociety. If you are not satisfied with your coaching session for any reason, please contact your coach directly to work out the details.</p>
<br/>
    <h2>7. Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for any injuries, damages, or losses that may occur during or as a result of your coaching session. You agree to assume all risk and responsibility for your own safety and well-being during the session. We recommend that you consult with your healthcare provider before beginning any exercise or fitness program.</p>

  <br/>
